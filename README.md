# Random Maker Projects
This repo includes code for projects which you can find on my youtube channel.

## File Structure
In the raspberry pi folder, you will find programs for the **raspberry pi** to run.

In the arduino folder, you will find projects for the **arduino** to run.

All of these projects have a tutorial, which will tell you how to use them.

In each project, there might be resources, which I will instruct you how to use in the video.

### Thank you for helping getting my youtube chnnel running!
